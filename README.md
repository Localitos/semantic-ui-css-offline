## Disclaimer

We need this change to off the call to google fonts. We don't use Lato font in our repository, but right now we can't stop using SemanticUI because it's still being used by some of our components.

This is a temporary change. 


## Original description from Semantic UI CSS

CSS  Distribution

This repository is automatically synced with the main [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) repository to provide lightweight CSS only version of Semantic UI.

This package **does not support theming** and includes generated CSS files of the default theme only.

You can view more on Semantic UI at [LearnSemantic.com](http://www.learnsemantic.com) and [Semantic-UI.com](http://www.semantic-ui.com)
